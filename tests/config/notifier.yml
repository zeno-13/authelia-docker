##
## Notification Provider
##
## Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a WebAuthn registration or a TOTP registration.
## The available providers are: filesystem, smtp. You must use only one of these providers.
notifier:
  ## You can disable the notifier startup check by setting this to true.
  disable_startup_check: false

  ##
  ## File System (Notification Provider)
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/t/statelessness
  ##
  filesystem:
    filename: '/config/notification.txt'

  ##
  ## SMTP (Notification Provider)
  ##
  ## Use a SMTP server for sending notifications. Authelia uses the PLAIN or LOGIN methods to authenticate.
  ## [Security] By default Authelia will:
  ##   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections
  ##      - use the disable_require_tls boolean value to disable this requirement
  ##        (only works for unauthenticated connections)
  ##   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
  ##     (configure in tls section)
  # smtp:
    ## The address of the SMTP server to connect to in the address common syntax.
    # address: 'smtp://127.0.0.1:25'

    ## The connection timeout in the duration common syntax.
    # timeout: '5 seconds'

    ## The username used for SMTP authentication.
    # username: 'test'

    ## The password used for SMTP authentication.
    ## Can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
    # password: 'password'

    ## The sender is used to is used for the MAIL FROM command and the FROM header.
    ## If this is not defined and the username is an email, we use the username as this value. This can either be just
    ## an email address or the RFC5322 'Name <email address>' format.
    # sender: 'Authelia <admin@example.com>'

    ## HELO/EHLO Identifier. Some SMTP Servers may reject the default of localhost.
    # identifier: 'localhost'

    ## Subject configuration of the emails sent. {title} is replaced by the text from the notifier.
    # subject: '[Authelia] {title}'

    ## This address is used during the startup check to verify the email configuration is correct.
    ## It's not important what it is except if your email server only allows local delivery.
    # startup_check_address: 'test@authelia.com'

    ## By default we require some form of TLS. This disables this check though is not advised.
    # disable_require_tls: false

    ## Disables sending HTML formatted emails.
    # disable_html_emails: false

    # tls:
      ## The server subject name to check the servers certificate against during the validation process.
      ## This option is not required if the certificate has a SAN which matches the address options hostname.
      # server_name: 'smtp.example.com'

      ## Skip verifying the server certificate entirely. In preference to setting this we strongly recommend you add the
      ## certificate or the certificate of the authority signing the certificate to the certificates directory which is
      ## defined by the `certificates_directory` option at the top of the configuration.
      ## It's important to note the public key should be added to the directory, not the private key.
      ## This option is strongly discouraged but may be useful in some self-signed situations where validation is not
      ## important to the administrator.
      # skip_verify: false

      ## Minimum TLS version for the connection.
      # minimum_version: 'TLS1.2'

      ## Maximum TLS version for the connection.
      # maximum_version: 'TLS1.3'

      ## The certificate chain used with the private_key if the server requests TLS Client Authentication
      ## i.e. Mutual TLS.
      # certificate_chain: |
        # -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        # ...
        # -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        # -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        # ...
        # -----END CERTIFICATE-----

      ## The private key used with the certificate_chain if the server requests TLS Client Authentication
      ## i.e. Mutual TLS.
      # private_key: |
        # -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        # ...
        # -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
