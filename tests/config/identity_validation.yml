## Identity Validation Configuration
##
## This configuration tunes the identity validation flows.
# identity_validation:

  ## Reset Password flow. Adjusts how the reset password flow operates.
  # reset_password:
    ## Maximum allowed time before the JWT is generated and when the user uses it in the duration common syntax.
    # jwt_lifespan: '5 minutes'

    ## The algorithm used for the Reset Password JWT.
    # jwt_algorithm: 'HS256'

    ## The secret key used to sign and verify the JWT.
    # jwt_secret: 'a_very_important_secret'

  ## Elevated Session flows. Adjusts the flow which require elevated sessions for example managing credentials, adding,
  ## removing, etc.
  # elevated_session:
    ## Maximum allowed lifetime after the One-Time Code is generated that it is considered valid.
    # code_lifespan: '5 minutes'

    ## Maximum allowed lifetime after the user uses the One-Time Code and the user must perform the validation again in
    ## the duration common syntax.
    # elevation_lifespan: '10 minutes'

    ## Number of characters the one-time password contains.
    # characters: 8

    ## In addition to the One-Time Code requires the user performs a second factor authentication.
    # require_second_factor: false

    ## Skips the elevation requirement and entry of the One-Time Code if the user has performed second factor
    ## authentication.
    # skip_second_factor: false
...
